        a. npm install lodash

6. I have implemented various features related to movie information within my application. Initially, I display a list of movies, allowing users to search for specific movies. Once a movie is selected, the user is directed to a dedicated 'Movie Details' page that provides comprehensive information about the selected movie. On this page, users can find detailed data such as the movie's title, poster, release date, runtime, director, and main cast members. Additionally, a brief overview of the movie is provided. To facilitate navigation, a home icon is available on the 'Movie Details' page. When clicked, this icon returns the user to the main movie list page, where they can explore more movies and perform searches.
